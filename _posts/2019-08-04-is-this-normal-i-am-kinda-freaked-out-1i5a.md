First of all, thank you for all your reactions and especially for the people who chose to follow me. I am flattened at this marvelous and wonderful community which is very helpful and above all inclined highly towards positive promotion and support to its users. Never have i before experienced such a response.

I joined on 2 Aug, almost 2 days back, and having almost 150+ people following me is really like freaking me out a bit. I just thought i'd write to the community.
