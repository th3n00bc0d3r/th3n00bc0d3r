When I was in the times of PHP, there was Wordpress, Joomla, Magento and Frameworks like SlimPHP, Laravel and much more but what about Angular/Node.

## Whats in my mind?
 1. Easy Themes
 2. Easy Plugins
 3. Serverless Deployment
 4. One Click Install

I did find some CMS like butterCMS for angular and stuff, but it all just seems a great oppurtunity, if some people can collaborate and perhaps create a new world within this world.

Lets see how everybody reacts.

I think getting together would be a big start in making things possible.
