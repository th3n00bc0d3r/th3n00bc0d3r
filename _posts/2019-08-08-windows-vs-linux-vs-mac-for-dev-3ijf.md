Life began with the first computer on Windows 98. Things were rigid but impressive. Time took its toll and heard about linux, what do we do with terminals and command prompt, how do we do it, it must be soo hard, and then came someone shouting,

{% raw %}```
Look at that, thats an expensive MAC
```{% endraw %}

Now once, i took the first steps of development or the path of becoming a developer, windows was at play. Things came up, things came down and I started coping with it. The age of viruses came, USBs sprung up, windows corrupted, all that Mambo Jambo was heavy but i survived.

As of Now!

### Windows
I have been using windows as a Gaming System, Playing Fortnite, Neir Automate, Final Fantasy XV. I connected to Playstation 3 Controllers via USB and Tekken 7, Mortal Kombat 11 is Fun. Now when it comes to writing code... Arrrh! its just too pointy, too rigid, getting the Environment Paths is kinda Pain. 

### MacOS
Now when I develop, I use my Macbook, why because, i feel setting up the environment and libraries for MacOS, is smooth. Kinda like tick tick tock and its done. The interface, I enjoy the animations and the way the desktop with the dockbar. Its simply productive.

### Linux
Now once again, reminds me a little about Mac and its workspace, setting up the environment, all good. Now i`d say its an affordable Mac for starters.

## So these are my findings, what do you think about yours?
