I have seen many people owning macbooks and yes, you love a mac but i have always been wondering that taking control of an environment on which you are highly dependent is a logical thing to do. I have seen people lack the basic skills of re-installing a windows, but when it comes to re-installing a MAC, Damn!, its technical.

{% raw %}```
I think.. "Technical is a term, invented to make people believe that they should not do something that the inventor wants to hide
```{% endraw %}

__LETS DEMYSTIFY THE MAC INSTALLATION__


Plug in the USB Mac Installer that we just made and Reboot your computer and hold __ Command (⌘) – R __

Now the first one your hard drive where the macOS exists and the circle icon is the USB. Use the keyboard and select the circle icon and press enter.
