I have done quite many projects with clients in PHP, but now I have moved away from PHP to Node.

I would like to know what do you guys have to say about it.

## My Opinion About PHP
It is a great powerful language to make your programming concepts very clear and how your code will translate, the language is based on original core concepts and as a beginner, i do highly recommend it.

## Node
Very Fast, Highly performative, a bit complex for beginners, and it has its own new concepts to embark upon. It is a versatile language and i think the demand for todays market.
