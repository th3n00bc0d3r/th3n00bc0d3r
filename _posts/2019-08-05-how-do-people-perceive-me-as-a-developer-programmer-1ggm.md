Well, I am glad I am way out of the early stages or perhaps the incubation state of being a dev. It was a form of hell sometimes, and it kept me thinking again and again, whether was i on the right path or not merely because man has evolved to adapt to its surroundings which it calls survival instinct. 

Therefore, In my opinion, here is a few things i conclude what people thought about me;


*   I was a laid back personality
*   I was careless, did not give a damn about anything
*   I used to just sit on the computer all the time and do nothing
*   I didn't used to make sense, like what are your talking about or lolx yeah your right.
*   Yeah keep up the good work, and you could see inside the eye, the person is thinking, what a joke, he is utter crap.
*   Do what you are told to, this is all crap
*   You should first complete your studies this will not help you.
*   Good Idea, but there are smarter people in the world that are way better than you
*   You cant do it because its not practical

I wonder what other things I have forgotten, I am glad I did, so what about you, I would really like to know, I am not the only one in the world who heard all this,
